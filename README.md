TerrainGeneration
=================

Parametric terrain generation toolset

This is an old project I worked on, the code is ugly and terribly written - I plan to rewrite it, probably without using the Windows MFC library.

The program starts out with a flat mesh, and provides a number of tools to alter the terrain. A number of terrain generation tools is provided, the effects of which can be accumulated on the same mesh. This started out as a Computer Graphics open ended term project.
